## Key Takeaways

### Topics Discussed:
  * What is  Cloud
  * Why Cloud
  * Essential Characteristics
  * Cloud Service Models
  * Deployment Model
  * Cloud Providers
  * Shared responsibility
  * How to access the cloud
  * Types of Infrastructure
  * Cloud Architect


**Cloud** - According to NIST[National Institute of Standards And Technology], Cloud is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. <br>

So Why Cloud ? <br>
Expert Support (AWS, Azure,GCP) <br>
Transfer of Risk - The cost for this is transferred to the cloud providers since it's managed by them. <br>
Stop reinventing the Wheel - Cloud Providers are providing lots of services and tools, so rather than making it yourself try using the one which is provided by cloud providers. <br>
Global Operations -Since data or information can be stored in his/her country cloud helps us to store the data in the respective country. <br>
Cost effective - We need to perform all the maintenance if it's On Premise. But in the cloud all the maintenance is done by cloud providers. <br>
<br>
Characteristics of Cloud <br>
    * On-demand self-service <br>
    * Broad network access
    * Resource pooling.
    * Rapid elasticity.
    * Measured service.
<br>
**Service Models** <br>
Software as a Service (SaaS)- The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user specific application configuration settings. 
Platform as a Service (PaaS) - The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.
 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).
Deployment Models:
 Private cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises. 
Community cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises. 
Public cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.
 Hybrid cloud. The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).

Who all provides Cloud ?
AWS, Azure, GCP, Digital Ocean etc


What do we do and what cloud providers do ?
Understanding Shared responsibility : Both the users and the cloud providers have their own responsibility. The cloud providers provide the services and they protect it. But the data stored in it is protected by users like encrypting, back-up etc.
Customer responsibility - Platform, Application management Data storage OS etc
Provider responsibility - Compute, storage, database, regions and availability zones etc
What is a management service ?
Suppose we need a database. We usually configure a server with our required database. But in the cloud all things will be managed by cloud providers. We just want to write and read data. Here an additional expense is incorporated. But this is an advantage for startups
We can access cloud through : 
Command line interface
Web interface/UI
API - We can integrate with our applications easily.
CDK(Cloud Development Kit) - We can program in our programming language and can do the operations easily. 
How cloud providers charge us  : 
According to the consumption of services
According to the Services provided
According to the Support 
Types of Infrastructure
Dedicated Infrastructure - Banking, insurance sector mainly uses these type of infrastructure. So it is more secure
Elastic Infrastructure - We can know the exact location. We only know the region where it's stored or hosted.
Migration - Moving existing infra to the cloud will be the main or basic operation we do usually. But in the cloud there are services which are really helpful. So in the application they implement the cloud services. So basically we are making the application cost effective.
Well Architecture Framework PDF 
Then try modifying the present architecture so that it becomes more cost effective. Think solutions in distributed architecture or how to convert to microservice architecture.
Design for failure - Design the architecture in a way that it will fail. 
Application Components preference - High availability should be the main standard
Which cloud should we use ?
For that check the criteria listed below:
How big is the community and how is it regular ?
Open Source contribution 
How is its(cloud providers) growth ?
For Beginners
Create a sql database and and retrive data
Configure a web server with a hello       message in an html file.
